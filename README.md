 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-MIT-blue)

## Description
   
  In this project I was tasked with creating an application that prompts a user with a series of questions that lead to a personal, generated SVG logo either shaped witha circle, square , or triangle.
  Futhermore you can choose the coors of the shapes fill as well as the color of the letters adding even more of a personal touch to your rendered logo.
